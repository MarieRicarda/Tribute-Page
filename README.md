# Tribute-Page

Continuing my journey of becoming a web developer! Recently, someone suggested that I sign up for a code camp. I've been doing the JS part of it but I decided to go back and get the HTML & CSS certificate part, even though I am familiar with these technologies. I was surprised to find out how much I didn't know! This is my rendition of the 1st project from the Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp.org. Hope everyone likes it!
